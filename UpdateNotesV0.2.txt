LocalQuest [BETA] V0.2 - What's new?!

- Welcome back beta testers!!
- First, same stuff as before:
 - During the beta, please try playing/modding different game versions!
 - If you find a game version < mid 2018 that doesn't seem to work, please tell me and I'll work on it!
 - Support for more builds coming soon!!
- New in 0.2 [|X3]
 - Support for more builds into 2019
 - Custom rooms too new for a build are now hidden from the play menu
 - Made UI boxes smaller so there aren't gaps on windows 10 / non-"terminal app" cmd
 - Added some UI sound like eq launcher
